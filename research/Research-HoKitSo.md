# Research on Timesheet Automation

## Research
1. Clockify has visual studio extension to track time, our team can use it as a reference. Also studied the Clockify API to see how can it be integrated into our project.
2. Creating CLI Executable global npm module. Our team can build the application as a npm package. The user can further install the package as a gloabl module and use it accordingly. I have also build a sample demo to show the team how it might work with the Greet example below.

3. Studied on the commande package and inquirer package to see which can help writing interactive command line. Although the Commander is more popular, it seems that the inquirer package is easier to use.


## Idea
1. User interact with the timesheet tracker with CLI
2. Record Time & other data 
3. Convert date to excel (VBA)

## CLI-Team: Flow of the application
1. Check whether the API Key is setup
    1. If it is not setup, ask for the API Key
2. Provide a list of funtions
    1. Export Excel
    2. Change API Key
