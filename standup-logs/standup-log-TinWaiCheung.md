Brainstorming of the features of Timesheet:
- shouldn't require much input data from the user
- can track the time of using coding softwares
- can automatically input data (e.g. date and time) to the timesheet
- can even record the file type that the users were coding on


8 FEB
Sharing and Researching:
- There are some extensions from the VS code e.g. Time Master, Code Time, Time Tracker, Compile Time

Time Master,
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iceworks-team.iceworks-time-master
> Can Check your Code Activity e.g. editor time, active code time, lines added...
> Can Generate Code Time Summary with Date and Code Activity!!

Code Time,
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.swdc-vscode
> More complicated, more functions
> Have accounts/ teams
> Personalized Code Time dashboard with code time, code time outside work hours, and meeting time 
> Can explore Data Visualizations e.g. bars and charts

Time Tracker,
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcambose.time-tracker
> Start/Stop time tracking
> Set break reminders
> Hourly salary calculator: Displays how much money you made during the last work session


15 FEB
- Discussion in team on the features of the timesheet
- Try to follow the video of Connecting Clockify to Google Sheets:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCfMUx4ZLSI 
to know how can the time data be outputed to the excel format.


22 FEB
- Discussion in team to divide our group work into 3 aspects, Command line interface, Clockify API and Excel Report.
- I joined the Excel Report division as I am more interested in the front-end output.
Here is the link to our Trello: {[link](https://trello.com/b/CL8l3a0i/http5214-time-keeper)}.
- Will research on how to create an excel file and printing output on it through code and terminal.


8 MAR
- participate in the coding of Creating an excel file
- help to do the planning of the next few weeks and writing the scope for our project
- will keep on trying to export the data to excel file


15 MAR
- Looking into teammates' codes of exporting Clockify data to excel file
- I'm going to format the time data into specific format (count by quarter like 0.25/ 0.5/ 0.75/ 1 )that Bernie required
- Blocker: I don't know how to change the _H_M_S format
- will need some more research


22 MAR
- I coded the formatClockifyTimeToRoundedDecimalTime and the exportTime function so the time data has been formated from _H_M_S to _:_ to decimal number counted by quarter
- I added the function to the loop that generates the Timesheet 
- I added the TOTAL time adding row and its value
- I also added some colors to the cells inside the excel to style it
- I interviewed the users in the user-testing and took note.


29 MAR
- I read over the user-testing report again.
- We discussed about the improvement on the app we can have. 
- we finished our requirements for the course and can wrap up our work!


5 APR
- We went through the summary of the user-testing report and the improvement.
- Our teammate Daniel made some extra features with the visible timer base on the comment we got. We reviewed and like it!
- No blockers as we won't be developing for the app for now. 
- We will add images to the README.md.


12 APR
- I updated the README of the repo with photos and instructions.
- finishing and passing the course.
- I am so tired.
