Brainstorming of the features of Timesheet:
- shouldn't require much input data from the user
- can track the time of using coding softwares
- can automatically input data (e.g. date and time) to the timesheet
- can even record the file type that the users were coding on

Sharing and Researching:
- There are some extensions from the VS code e.g. Time Master, Code Time, Time Tracker, Compile Time

to know how can the time data be outputed to the excel format.

Here is the link to our Trello: {[link](https://trello.com/b/CL8l3a0i/http5214-time-keeper)}.
- Will research on how to create an excel file and printing output on it through code and terminal.
